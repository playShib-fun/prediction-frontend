# Design Document

## Overview

The redesigned how-to-play page will transform the current informational layout into an engaging, gamified experience that matches the platform's aesthetic. The design will emphasize visual storytelling, interactive elements, and progressive disclosure of information to guide users through the prediction game mechanics in an intuitive and exciting way.

The page will maintain the existing three-tab structure (Overview, Step-by-Step, FAQ) but enhance each section with improved visual hierarchy, animations, and gamified elements that create a cohesive experience with the main platform.
